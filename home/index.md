	 I bought a Nexus One about a year ago in the hopes of
	 replacing my Palm with something better.&nbsp;Now a year later it still
	 doesn't come close to replacing the functionality of my Treo 680.&nbsp;<br />
	 My long term goal is to build an Android sync conduit for
	 Contacts and Calendar and write a Tasks, Memos, and Keyring app with
	 sync conduits.<br />
	 With this goal in mind I completed my first Android application <a href="http://flippedbits.com/jcalc/">J-Calc</a>.

	 J-Pilot version 1.6.2 released.&nbsp;<br />
	 This is mostly a bugfix release.&nbsp; Contacts created on the Palm were not always synced correctly,
	 and Bugzilla 1973 (Contacts with pictures cause segfault) was fixed.

	 Ludovic Rousseau for his Debian packages and patches.&nbsp;<br /><br />

	 Why version 1.6.0?  The version number for J-Pilot has always been about the level of functionality that it had.  The first version 9 years ago was 0.90 because I thought it was 90% done.  I was wrong, but
	 that's where it started.  It never quite got to where I wanted for a 1.0 release.  With the newer database code (Contacts and Memos) requiring major rewrites of much of the code it didn't make sense
	 to approach 1.0 anymore, but 2.0.  If supporting Contacts, Calendar, Memos, and Tasks is 2.0, then we are at 1.6.0.

	 J-Pilot and Pilot-Link work with about any PalmOS device.  I recommend the newest kernel possible.  The Treo 90 and 300s will work with  kernel 2.4.20 and this patch 
	 <a href="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/usb/2.4/usb-visor-rollup-2.4.20.patch"> visor rollup patch</a>.&nbsp;<br /> Thanks to Handspring for being cooperative with us.&nbsp;  All USB PalmOS
	 devices except for the Handspring visors currently don't work with BSD with the USB stack.&nbsp;  You can, however do a network hotsync with them.&nbsp;  Read this 
	 <a href="http://lists.pilot-link.org/pipermail/pilot-link-general/2003-February/000896.html">link</a> for how to do it.&nbsp;
