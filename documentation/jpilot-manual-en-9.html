<P>Choose the localization for the abbreviated dates field. 
<P>
<P>Choose the localization for the long dates field. 
<P>
<P>Choose the localization of the time field. 
<P>
<P><B>*Hint*</B> Some  displays will flicker  with every change
of the  clock, so  you may not  want the clock  updating every
second. In this case, choose  one of the time settings without
seconds.  Then thetime will update every minute.
<P>
<P>Choose the first  day of the week. The  next time the calendar
is ire-drawn it will use the  this day ofthe week to start the
week on.
<P>
<P>Select a GTK  colors file. J-Pilot must be  restarted for this
change to take effect. 
<P>
<P>Set the  serial port. If  this is empty, then  the environment
variable PILOTPORT will be used.  If PILOTPORT is not set then
the default of /dev/pilot is used.
<P>
<P>Set  the serial rate.  Some computers  will not  sync reliably
above 9600.  I am not sure why this is. 
<P>
<P>Set  &quot;show  deleted  records&quot;.   Having  this  box
checked means that deleted records will still bedisplayed as a
different color. This can be confusing at times.
<P>
<P>Set &quot;show  modified deleted records&quot;.  Having this
box checked  means that when a record  ismodified the original
record will still be displayed  as a different color. This can
be very confusing at times.
