</H2>

<P>
<P>Many things in this document  are pretty much self explanatory, like a
lot of  the text on how to  use J-Pilot. I have  written this document
for a user as  well as someone who is thinking about  being a user and
wants to know  the capabilities of J-Pilot before  much time is wasted
downloading andcompiling it, etc. 
<P>In  the  using  J-Pilot  section,  I  have  marked  some  things  with
&quot;*Hint*&quot; that I  think may not be right  away obvious to a
new user. If you are in a hurry, just read these. 
<P>The version this manual refers to is <B>Version 0.98</B>.
