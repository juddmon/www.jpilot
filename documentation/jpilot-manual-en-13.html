<H2><A NAME="ss13.1">13.1 What are Plugins?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>A plugin is code that  can extend the functionality of j-pilot
without adding any code to  j-pilot, or recompiling it.  It is
basically  just  a shared  library  that contains  pre-defined
callback functions.
<P>A callback function is a  function that is not called from the
application  itself,  but  from  an  external  program.;  When
J-Pilot starts up it will  scan the plugin directories for any
shared       libraries       (<CODE>~/.jpilot/plugins/       and
$BASE_DIR/share/jpilot/plugins)</CODE>.&nbsp;  When  it finds  a
shared library  it will find callback functions  inside of the
library and call  them when needed.&nbsp; So, a  plugin can be
an integral part of the  overall program just by its existence
and  when taken  away the  main  program will  still run  only
missing the functionality that the plugin provided.

<P>
<P>To  find  available  plugins  check  my plugin  page  at  
<A HREF="http://jpilot.linuxbox.com/plugins.html">jpilot.linuxbox.com/plugins.html</A> where I keep a list.

<H2><A NAME="ss13.3">13.3 Creating plugins</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If  you  plan  on  writing  a  plugin,  check  my  pages  
<A HREF="http://jpilot.linuxbox.com/plugin.html">http://jpilot.linuxbox.com/plugin.html</A>     for    more
information. I have gathered infos  on how to write and how to
implement. Good luck, users will be thankfull.
<P>If you do  create a plugin I would appreciate  it if you would
give me a link to the site so that I can put it on my website.
This  will  encourage more  people  to  use  J-Pilot and  your
plugin. Even  if you are  working on a  plugin you can  let me
know and  I will put  it down as  in progress so  that someone
doesn't   duplicate   your   effort.    My   email   is

<H2><A NAME="ss13.4">13.4 Installing Plugins</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>To  be able to  use a  plugin it  has to  be in  the directory
<CODE>$BASEDIR/share/jpilot/plugins</CODE>              with
<CODE>$BASEDIR</CODE>   being   <CODE>/usr/local</CODE>   under
normal  circumstances. If  located there  JPilot will  find it
checking  the directory  on the  next startup  and  provide an
entry in the JPilot menu. 
<P>If you are having problems  installing a plugin check the 
<A HREF="jpilot-manual-en-14.html#faq">FAQ</A> for further information. 
<P>To find out how to compile a given plugin check the archiv you
downloaded  for  the INSTALL  File.  Normally the  compilation
should work using the standard commands:
<PRE>
        ./configure
        make
        make install
        
</PRE>

Having done that the new plugin should reside in the directory
<CODE>$BASEDIR/share/jpilot/plugins</CODE>. 
<P>With that  you have done  everything necessary to  install the
plugin. After  the next  startup of JPilot  you should  be the
proud owner of a shiny and fresh new plugin. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.5">13.5 System wide or user installation</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>You  can install  a  plugin system  wide  using the  procedure
explained        above        into        the        directory
<CODE>$BASEDIR/share/jpilot/plugins</CODE>.  Doing that all
the users  of the system can  make use of  the newly installed
plugin. But - you will need to be <CODE>root</CODE> to do so. 
<P>If you want to install the  plugin for just one user - because
of a  reason what so  ever - you  can do so by  installing the
plugin      files     (,,.so``)      to      the     directory
<CODE>$HOME/.jpilot/plugins</CODE>. That  way only the user
can use the plugin that it was installed in.
