<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Installation</A></H2>

<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Prerequisites</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>GTK+,  and glib  (installed by  default on  most  Linux distributions)
pilot-link (comes with many distributions)
<P>To compile  J-Pilot you need to  have GTK+1.2 or  later installed. You
can find out what version you have by running 
<P>
<PRE>
gtk-config --version
</PRE>
<P>GTK+ requires  glib. The  glib version probably  should match  the gtk
version.  You can also do a 
<P>
<PRE>
glib-config --version
</PRE>
<P>You can get these at 
<A HREF="http://www.gtk.org">www.gtk.org</A><P>Pilot link  must be installed and  working. What I mean  by working is
that you can use pilot-xfer,memos, or some other pilot-link program.
<P>David Silber has some pretty  good documentation for using Palm Pilots
with      Linux     at      
<A HREF="http://www.orbits.com/Palm/">www.orbits.com/Palm/</A>.   The pilot-link  code can  be  found at
<A HREF="ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/">ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/</A>   If   you   are   installing
pilot-link   from   RPMs   make   sure   that  you   also   have   the
<B>pilot-link-dev  rpm</B> installed  for the  header files  so that
J-Pilot can compile.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Compiling</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>To compile and install do the following: 
<P>
<PRE>
./configure 
make 
make install 

jpilot 
</PRE>
<P>For Japanese support, use 
<PRE>
./configure --with-japanese

./configure --help 
</PRE>
<P>will list all the options available. 
<P>
<PRE>
make uninstall
</PRE>
<P>is also an option, however I do not recommend using this ;) 
<P>I have included a spec file so  if you want to create your own RPM all
you have to do is 
<PRE>
rpm -t jpilot-0.96.tar.gz
</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Disclaimer</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>J-Pilot was written in such a way that it should be very safe to sync.
There  is always the  possibilityof something  going wrong  though. As
with anything else, backup your data  if you cannot afford to lose it.
Just make sure your backup software doesn't destroy it first.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Serial Port Setup</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>When  syncing, J-Pilot uses  the port  and speed  settings out  of the
J-Pilot preferences screen. If the port is blank then J-Pilot will use
the PILOTPORT environment variables,  as does pilot-link. If these are
blank also then J-Pilot will default to /dev/pilot. It is recommended,
but not necessary to make a link from /dev/pilot to the correct serial
port.   So,  if your  cradle  is on  COM1,  this  is /dev/ttyS0  under
Linux. You could execute the command 
<PRE>
ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/pilot
</PRE>
 COM2 is /dev/ttyS1, and so on.  
<P>The Linux  serial ports cua[n]  are going away.   You should
use the ttyS[n] ports instead.
<P>You must  also give  non-root users permissions  to access  the serial
port.  The command to do this is (as root) 
<PRE>
chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0
</PRE>
 
for the first serial port, ttyS1, for the second, and so on. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Color Files</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Make   install   will   copy    a   few   default   color   files   to
/usr/local/share/jpilot/  (unless you  told configure  to  use another
prefix).
<P>These will be selectable from  the preferences menu. Also J-Pilot will
look in  $HOME/.jpilot/ for colors files. They  must start with
&quot;jpilotrc&quot;.  If  you want to  add new ones, or  modify the
current ones, just put the files  in one of these directories and they
will show up in the preferences menu.
<P>If you create your own cool jpilotrc files feel free to send them back
to me and if I like it, I'llinclude it in the release.
