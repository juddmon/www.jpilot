<P>JPilot  comes with  a handy  feature -  printing. It  uses the
ability to export any  data in postscript format. So, printing
out ouf JPilot will create a postsript file that can either be
printed directly or written to a file.
<P>To print, click on the  <EM>File</EM> entry in the JPilot menu
and then hit <EM>Print</EM>. This  will bring up a window with
the printing options.
<P>First you can select wether to print 
<UL>
<LI>One record  - Just  print the chosen  (i.e. highlighted)
record. </LI>
<LI>All records in this category  - Print all the records of
the current category. </LI>
<LI>Print all records - Will export all the records that are
stored in the application (to do, datebook ...)</LI>
</UL>
<P>Further more you can specify to print just one record onto one
page (one record per page) which is a waste of paper but comes
in handy sometimes. 
<P>To specify the blank lines  between the records enter a number
after that. 
<P>Now, in the field  <EM>Print Command</EM> you can specify what
to do with  the exported file. Remember that  JPilot exports a
postscript file.  That file can be send to different commands.
To actually  print the  file just enter  <CODE>lpr</CODE>.  JPilot
will  utter  the  command  <CODE>lpr</CODE>  <EM>printfile.ps</EM>
which will  result in  the file being  printed.  To  write the
file to  disc, just replace the <CODE>lpr</CODE>  command with the
<CODE>cat</CODE> command  and a pipe  together with a  target file
like shown in brackets. That will do.
<P>Hitting print will print, hitting cancel will cancel - but you
already guessed it!
