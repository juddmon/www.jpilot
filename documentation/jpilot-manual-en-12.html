<H2><A NAME="ss12.1">12.1 Restoring a Palm Pilot </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This is not part of J-Pilot. 
<P>J-Pilot stores its  files in $HOME/.jpilot/. To restore
a palm pilot that has lost its data you can use the pilot-xfer
program  that comes with  pilot-link.  The  easiest way  to do
this  is  to  put  every  file that  you  want  installed  (or
restored) back  on the palm  pilot in one directory.  For this
example,  a  directory called  backup.  Then  you can  execute
<PRE>
pilot-xfer -r backup
</PRE>
<P><B>Do not</B>  install applications that are  already in ROM
on the palm pilot, such as the Address.prc, etc.
<P><B>Do not</B>  try to use j-pilot  to sync data  back into a
reset  palm pilot. It  will overwrite  the data  on thedesktop
with the  empty palm pilot files.  This may change  in a later
release.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.2">12.2 Use of the HOME environment variable</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Normally,  you can just  leave HOME  alone.  J-Pilot  uses the
HOME environment  variable to make  it easy to  allow multiple
pilots to be synced under the  same user. Just set HOME to the
directory you want J-Pilot to use.
<P>For example,  I have 2 palm pilots.  I can sync the  one I use
all the time  into /home/judd.  The other one  I can sync into
/home/judd/palm2 by using this script:
<P>
<PRE>
        #! /bin/bash
        HOME=/home/judd/palm2 
        jpilot 
        
</PRE>
<P>This  is  also  handy   for  syncing  xcopilot  into  its  own
directory.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.3">12.3 Oops, Reverting</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>You can always make the databases revert back to the last time
that the  pilot was  synced.  All youhave  to do  is &quot;rm
~/.jpilot/*.pc&quot;.  Deleted  records will come back,
modified records will be un-modified, etc.
<P>Nothing is permanent until the sync/backup. You can do this if
you make  a mistake, or just  to play around  with J-Pilot and
then  delete the  changed  records without  syncing them.  For
example if  you want  to restore the  addresses to  their last
sync state you can remove~/.jpilot/AddressDB.pc.
<P>Also,  from  the preferences  menu,  you  can  choose to  show
deleted records  and then click  on thedeleted record  and use
&quot;Add&quot; to get a copy of it back.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.4">12.4 Feedback/Contributions</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>I always like  to here feedback from users.  Sometimes I get a
little busy with  email and my payingjob, but  I should always
respond.
<P>If you want to contribute some  code just email me and tell me
what you want to do, or  have alreadydone, etc. I may like it,
and I may not. You are always free to do what you want to with
the source code.
<P>If  you really  want to  give me  something for  my  effort in
putting  together  this program.  You  can  send  me a  little
donation. I collect coins from anywhere, anytime also.
