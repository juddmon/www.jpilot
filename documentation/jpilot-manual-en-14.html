<H2><A NAME="s14">14. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="faq"></A> <P>
<H2><A NAME="ss14.1">14.1 Why is it called J-Pilot? Its not written in Java.</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P><B>Answer</B>:  Originally I wrote  this program  for Myself
and my  Wife to use.   The J was  for Judd or Jacki.  Not much
thought was  put into  this. Then, out  of the goodness  of my
heart, I wanted to release it under the GPL.
<P>I asked  around for  some better names,  but I didn't  come up
with  one.  gtkpilot  would be  more appropriate,  but  I hate
typing gtk.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss14.2">14.2 Why do you give it away for free?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P><B>Answer</B>: 1. Because I can. 2. World Domination.
<P>I would like to see Linux, become the dominate desktop both in
the workplace and at home.  This is one of my contributions to
help make it  happen. The more people that  use Linux at home,
the more  I benefit from  the hardware support  and commercial
software that will become available.
<P>The more Linux/Unix  is used in the office,  the more pleasant
my job becomes.   If I drove cars for a  living, I'd rather be
driving  Ferraris  and  Corvettes  around than  Chevettes  and
Yugos.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss14.3">14.3 Are you going to Gnome-ify it, or KDE-ify it?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P><B>Answer</B>: I don't run KDE,  or Gnome, and at this point
I don't  even know what it  would take to do  this. If someone
else wants  to do  this, that is  ok.  My only  requirement is
that KDE, or Gnome isn't required to run J-Pilot.
<P>I  take pride  in the  fact  that Linux/Unix  has many  window
managersavailable to use.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss14.4">14.4 How do I cut-and-paste?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P><B>Answer</B>: Cut is ctrl-c and paste is ctrl-v. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss14.5">14.5 The sync or backup  quits because of ,,weird packages``. What's</A>
the problem?</H2>

<P>
<P><B>Answer</B>:  A know limitation  of either  the pilot-link
package (i.e.   pilot-xfer) or the Linux  serial port.  Either
is still in  discussion.  Some PCs seem to  have problems with
higher transmission speeds.  <B>Solution:</B> Set the serial
speed to 9600. That should fix the problem.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss14.6">14.6 I  installed a  plugin  but it  won't  show up  in JPilot.  Now</A>
what?</H2>

<P>
<P><B>Answer:</B>  First  be   sure  to  restart  JPilot  after
installing the  plugin since JPilot looks for  plugins only at
startup in <CODE>$BASEDIR/share/jpilot/plugins</CODE>. 
<P>If you  obeyed the installation hints from  the plugin author,
the           plugin           should          be           in
<CODE>$BASEDIR/share/jpilot/plugins</CODE>. If  not, try to
find out where  it went and copy the files  of the plugin into
<CODE>$BASEDIR/share/jpilot/plugins</CODE> by hand. 
<P>Still  no plugin?  Then  it's reasonably  safe  to think  that
either the plugin is not compatible to JPilot or JPilot is not
installed correctly. Also check above under Plugins.
