<p>Why version 1.6.0?  The version number for J-Pilot has always been about the level of functionality that it had.
The first version 9 years ago was 0.90 because I thought it was 90% done.  I was wrong, but
that’s where it started.  It never quite got to where I wanted for a 1.0 release.
With the newer database code (Contacts and Memos) requiring major rewrites of much of the code it didn’t make sense
to approach 1.0 anymore, but 2.0.  If supporting Contacts, Calendar, Memos, and Tasks is 2.0, then we are at 1.6.0.</p>
