<H3>Setting up a Nexus One for use without a data plan</H3>
There are plenty of people who want a smartphone, but do not wish to pay the outrageous data plan fees.&nbsp;  This is one of the reasons I was so excited to see Google release the Nexus One.&nbsp;
I used the phone for a few weeks and did not miss having WAN data one bit.&nbsp;  I can use wi-fi at home and at work and plenty of places around town.&nbsp;
<p>
When a Nexus One is powered up for the first time it will immediately try to connect to google and wherever else as part of its setup.&nbsp;  If you don't have a data plan that could cost you money.&nbsp;
My AT&T plan will charge me a $2 minumum and I could quickly exceed that and get into more charges.&nbsp;  To avoid that first you need to power up the device with <b>no SIM card
installed.&nbsp;</b>  If the SIM card is in it and the access point settings are correct you may incur charges.&nbsp;
<p>
Boot the phone and go through the first time setup.&nbsp;  You can connect to wi-fi if its available.&nbsp;

You must enter something for the Name and the APN field at a minumum.&nbsp;  I put in Null, but anything works, or doesn't work, since the point is to have it not work.&nbsp;

<p>
You may now shutdown the phone, put in your SIM card and boot back up without a data connection happening.&nbsp;  The phone will try to connect over the "Null" APN and fail to connect.&nbsp;Wi-fi
will work fine and you can still browse the web, use email, google maps, etc.&nbsp;
<p>
Now donate $30/month to a charity or your retirement account.
