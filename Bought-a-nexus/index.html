<p>I bought a Nexus One about a year ago in the hopes of
replacing my Palm with something better. Now a year later it still
doesn’t come close to replacing the functionality of my Treo 680.</p>

<p>My long term goal is to build an Android sync conduit for
Contacts and Calendar and write a Tasks, Memos, and Keyring app with
sync conduits.</p>

<p>With this goal in mind I completed my first Android application <a href="http://flippedbits.com/jcalc/">J-Calc</a></p>
